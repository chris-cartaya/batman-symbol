## Description

This project is inspired by a video from the YouTube channel [One Person Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iruECu19Nx4) titled "Designing the BATMAN LOGO in HTML and CSS." While following along with the tutorial, I made several modifications to the code, including reducing the number of `div` elements and refactoring the HTML and CSS to improve readability and maintainability.

### Modifications
- Removed two extra `div` elements by modifying CSS properties.
- Grouped common CSS properties and added shared classes (`ovals`, `top-ovals`, `bottom-ovals`, `bottom-outer-ovals`, `bottom-inner-ovals`) to avoid code duplication.
- Added `id` attributes to `div` elements to target specific elements in the CSS.
- Refactored CSS to improve readability and maintainability by organizing properties and using more descriptive class names.
